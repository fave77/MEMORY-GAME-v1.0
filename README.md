# MEMORY GAME v1.0

**MEMORY GAME v1.0** is a browser-based online educational game that requires a player to match similar fruits! For example, 16 cards; composed of 8 pairs, face down in random order. A player turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory. This is also known as the [Pelmanism][1] principle, after **Christopher Louis Pelman**, a British psychologist of the 20th century.

> Wanna check your brain's ability to memorize? ...well now you can with this shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!

#### RULES

How The Game Works:

- The player selects the difficulty level according to which the timer adjusts.
- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying fruit.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same fruit.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The above four steps are equivalent to 1 move.

The game ends when the **timer** goes to zero or player wins by matching all the cards! The number of **moves** a player took to win the game determines the **star rating**.
